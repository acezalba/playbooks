# My Localhost Ansible Scripts

## Rationale

It is incredibly tiring to continuously refer to a tutorial every time I have to setup the scaffolding of a coding project and remember it and my modifications to it the moment I create another one. This includes adapting an old tutorial to include newer tools, implementing my own custom files, as well as merging multiple tutorials together to handle a use case.

## Added Community Modules

- `community.mysql`
- `community.general.random_string`
